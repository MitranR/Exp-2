# Exp - 2 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:

To draw a UML diagram for a library management system

# SRS (Procedure):

Actors Used-:

  1.Librarian

  2.Student

  3.Publisher

  4.Admin


 Software - StarUML
 

List of Diagrams -:

  1.Class Diagram
  
  2.Usecase Diagra
  
  3.Package Diagram

  4.Activity Diagram

  5.Communication Diagram

  6.Sequence Diagram

Procedure-:

1.Define System Requirements: Outline the functional and non-functional requirements, such as user authentication and transaction processing.

2.Identify Key Actors and Use Cases: Determine actors and define their interactions.

3.Design the System Architecture: Break down the system into components

4.Create UML Diagrams: Develop use case, class, sequence, and activity diagrams based on the system design.

5.Test and Validate: Perform testing to ensure the system meets functional requirements and security standards.
